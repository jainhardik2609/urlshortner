# Getting Started

## Project Build 


To build this project, run

```
git clone https://github.com/zeeshaanahmad/url-shortener.git
cd url-shortener
gradle clean build
```

## Deployment

Project build can be deployed using docker-compose.yml which sets up two containers for
* MySql
* REST API

To deploy the project, run

```
docker-compose up --build
```

### db.Dockerfile
`db.Dockerfile` builds the docker image for MySql using MySql version 8 as the base image. It uses `schema.sql` at startup to set up the database schema.

### api.Dockerfile
`api.Dockerfile` sets up an image to deploy the project's jar file generated above from `build/libs/url-shortener-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. It exposes the API on port `8080`

### docker-compose.yml
Provides the configuration for containers to host API and MySql.
